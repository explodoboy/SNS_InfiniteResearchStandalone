<description>Mod Version 1.0 "The Infinite Staircase To Nowhere"

Welcome to Science Never Stops: Infinite Research Only (SNS: IRO)

This mod is quite simple, all it does is add an infinite research at the very end of the tech tree that can NEVER be completed. (And if it can, then you've discovered a massive, massive bug!)

...That's literally it. It doesn't do much else, nor does it mess with Science Never Stops: Ambition of the Cosmic, its submod, or the mod it's based off of.

Good luck.
